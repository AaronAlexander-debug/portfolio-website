<div class=portfolio-info>
<p>My first fully completed project! All credit goes out to The Odin Project, which has helped to facilitate the development of this project and previous projects during the summer of 2021. There is little to no real functionality on the faux-Google homepage, but it features the search bar, a fully optimized nav and footer bar, and basic HTML and CSS functions such as box shadows, hovering mechanics, and the manipulation of padding and margins to change the positions of the objects on the page.</p>

<p>My first prototype project, facilitated by The Odin Project. This website notably features HTML, CSS, and bits of JavaScript that is included with the 'Log In' feature of the website. Unfortunately due to issues with Git and the macOS Terminal, I am unable to host this project with a link, but I have nevertheless provided the link to the direct GitHub project above.</p>

<h2><a href=https://github.com/Sparky-4/Numonix class=github-link>Numonix</a> <span>&#8226;</span> completed April 2021</h2>

<div class=portfolio-info>
<p>This project was the result of a weekend-long experience with the <a href=https://hackvh.github.io/ class=normal-link>HackVH Virtual High School Hackathon</a>, my first major foray into the field of web/software development. I quickly learned the basics of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS thanks to my collaboration with an awesome team of guys that helped build the Numonix website, tackling a chronic academic need to improve performance with the usage of a customized study plan based on the concept of spaced repetition.</p>
<p>We would, awesomely enough, get into the top 10 of contestants, excluding the beginners! I was personally responsible for the design aspect, creating the logo for the website and creating the YouTube video that helped sell our concept to the judges, which can be viewed <a href=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqvLdxUZIlc&ab_channel=AaronAlexander class=normal-link>here</a>!</p>
