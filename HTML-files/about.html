<p>Hello! My name is Aaron Alexander, a rising college freshman at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, and this is my personal website.</p> 
<p>As an aspiring software developer, I am fully prepared to embark on a great journey toward achieving my dreams and mastering the world of computer science. I have previously taken an AP Computer Science A class during my senior year, but this summer I have fully committed myself to learning the basics of web development (HTML, JavaScript, and CSS). Wish me luck!</p>
<p>In my spare time, I love to play guitar and make music.</p>
<p>When I’m not jamming out to music or being exceedingly curious, I love to watch movies and study history. If there was one career beside software development that I’d pursue, it’d certainly be as a history professor at some big-time Ivy League school.</p>
<p>Currently, my professional goals are to improve my web development skills, improve upon the quality of this website, and create better projects in the future. In 10 years, I see myself hopefully owning my own multi-million dollar Silicon Valley software corporation that’ll rival the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, and Google whilst also providing innumerable job opportunities to minorities, women, and other historically disenfranchised groups within STEM.</p>
